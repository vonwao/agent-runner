# Runr Recommended .gitignore
# Copy this to your project's .gitignore

# === COMMIT THESE (configuration and tasks are project assets) ===
# .runr/runr.config.json
# .runr/tasks/**/*.md
# .runr/packs/**  (if you use custom packs)
# AGENTS.md
# CLAUDE.md

# === IGNORE THESE (runtime artifacts, not semantic code) ===

# Run artifacts (timelines, state, logs)
.runr/runs/

# Worktrees (isolated git trees for concurrent execution)
.runr-worktrees/
.agent-worktrees/  # Legacy

# Orchestration artifacts
.runr/orchestrations/

# Temporary files
.runr/tmp/
.runr/.tmp/

# === OPTIONAL: Bundle audit trail (human-readable history) ===
# If you want to commit run evidence, use bundles instead of raw state:
# !.runr/bundles/*.md  # Uncomment to commit curated bundle outputs

# === LEGACY PATHS (if migrating from agent-runner) ===
.agent/runs/
.agent/orchestrations/
.agent/worktrees/
