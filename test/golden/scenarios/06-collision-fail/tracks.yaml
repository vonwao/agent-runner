# Scenario 06: Collision fail policy
# Tests: collision_policy=fail → orchestration stops cleanly on collision
#
# Two tracks both target the same file (src/shared/collision.ts)
# With fail policy, the second track should fail when collision is detected

tracks:
  - name: track-a
    steps:
      - task: tasks/a.md
        allowlist:
          - src/shared/collision.ts

  - name: track-b
    steps:
      - task: tasks/b.md
